# Blokers and Solutions
First task is very straight forward, I found my plot previously was of high skewness thus googled for an answer. That's how I keep consistent with the graph provided. 
For the second task, I think I should spend more time finding the qualified data! The data I used, although free, made less sense providing useful implications. I am lucky this is not the final task.
